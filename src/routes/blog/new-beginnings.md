Very excited to share the news that me and my spouse moved to Calgary. 

I recently decided to take the offer to work on a fast growing video platform - Vidflex. Very excited to meet new people and work on interesting projects.

Despite COVID-19 we enjoy exploring the city and the nearby mountains. We have Rockies only an hour away from our place. We are very excited about that. 

Our new neighborhood is very lovely, its called Beltline. We are at the walking distance to pretty much anything.
