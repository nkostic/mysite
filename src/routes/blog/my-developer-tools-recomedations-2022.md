Here is a list of web development tools I started using in 2021 and am still happy to use in 2022.

- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) is very fast!
- [Svekte-kit](https://kit.svelte.dev/) is a fast, modern, and powerful meta framework for building modern web apps.
- [Github](https://github.com/)[Copilot](https://copilot.github.com/) is pretty darn cool!
- [StoryBook for svelte](https://storybook.js.org/blog/storybook-for-svelte/) is sweet.
- With [Chromatic](https://www.chromatic.com/) Storybook is distributed  and secure in no time.
- [Cloudflare](https://www.cloudflare.com/en-ca/) is hot!
- [Cypress](https://www.cypress.io/) for test development experience.
